Description: This package provides a flexible framework for fitting penalized regression models with a variety of penalty functions, including Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, SCAD, and MCP. It supports multiple optimization methods such as gradient descent (GD), coordinate gradient descent (CGD), and primal-dual algorithms (PD). The main interface allows users to specify the desired penalty and optimization technique, offering a unified approach to regularized regression.
