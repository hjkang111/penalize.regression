Description:  
  This package provides a comprehensive implementation of penalized regression  
  models using three optimization algorithms - Coordinate Descent Algorithm (CDA),  
  Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), and Local Linear Approximation (LLA).  
  It supports popular penalties including Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, SCAD, and MCP.  
  Users can flexibly choose penalty methods and algorithms, adjust tuning parameters,  
  and apply the package for both convex and non-convex regularization problems.  
  The package aims to offer efficient and reliable estimation of regression coefficients  
  under various penalty settings.
