# Introduction

## Introduction with penalize regression
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

# Penalize Regression Method

## Penalize Regression - Ridge
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Penalize Regression - Lasso
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Penalize Regression - Elastic Net
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Penalize Regression - MCP
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Penalize Regression - SCAD
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.


# Algorithms

## Gradient Descent Algorithm (GD)
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Coordinate Descent Algorithm (CDA)
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Projected Gradient Descent Algorithm (PGD)
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA)
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

## Newton-Raphson Algorithm (NR)
- A decision tree is a predictive model that splits the input space into regions using simple decision rules.

# R Package

## Functions
```{r}
sq.loss <- function(y) {
  y.bar <- mean(y)
  sum((y - y.bar)^2)
}
```
- We construct the following procedure for regression, where we apply a loss measure sq.loss function to the argument branch function.
